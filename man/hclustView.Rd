\usage{
hclustView(d, method = "average", label_cols = NULL, bar_cols = NULL,
  main = NA, xlab = NA, horiz = TRUE, ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{d}{A dissimilarity structure as produced by dist.}

\item{method}{The agglomeration method to be used. This should be (an unambiguous abbreviation of) one of "ward.D", "ward.D2", "single", "complete", "average" (= UPGMA), "mcquitty" (= WPGMA), "median" (= WPGMC) or "centroid" (= UPGMC).}

\item{label_cols}{A vector to be used as label's colors for the dendrogram.}

\item{bar_cols}{Either a vector or a matrix, which will be plotted as a colored bar.}

\item{main}{As in 'plot'.}

\item{xlab}{As in 'plot'.}

\item{horiz}{Logical indicating if the dendrogram should be drawn horizontally or not.}

\item{...}{Arguments to be passed to methods, such as graphical parameters (see par).}
}
\value{
Plot figure on open device.
