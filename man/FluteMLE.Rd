\value{
All of the pipeline results is output into the \code{out.dir}/\code{prefix}_Results,
which includes a pdf file and many folders. The pdf file '{prefix}_Pipeline_results.pdf' is the
summary of pipeline results. For each section in this pipeline, figures and useful data are
outputed to corresponding subfolders.
Distribution_of_BetaScores: Density plot and violin plot of beta scores.
MAplot: Maplot for each normalized data.
Linear_Fitting_of_BetaScores: Linear fitting of beta scores indicates the difference of cell cycle
time between Control and Treatment samples.
Scatter_Treat_Ctrl: Positive selection and negative selection
Enrichment_Treat-Ctrl: Enrichment analysis for positive and negative selection genes
Pathview_Treat_Ctrl: Pathway view for top enriched pathways
Scatter_9Square: Using 9 Square to select drug related genes
Enrichment_9Square: Enrichment analysis for selected genes
Pathview_9Square: Pathway view for top enriched pathways

\description{
Integrative analysis pipeline using the gene summary table in MAGeCK MLE results
}
\details{
MAGeCK-MLE can be used to analyze screen data from multi-conditioned experiments. MAGeCK-MLE
also normalizes the data across multiple samples, making them comparable to each other. The most important
ouput of MAGeCK MLE is `gene_summary` file, which includes the beta scores of multiple conditions and
the associated statistics. The `beta score`  for each gene describes how the gene is selected: a positive
beta score indicates a positive selection, and a negative beta score indicates a negative selection.

The downstream analysis includes identifying essential, non-essential, and target-associated genes,
and performing biological functional category analysis and pathway enrichment analysis of these genes.
The function also visualizes genes in the context of pathways to benefit users exploring screening data.
